This process, however, required the power of two Celestials together and Ego was not quite powerful enough to fulfill the Expansion alone, so he traveled across the universe from planet to planet impregnating thousands of female humanoid aliens in attempt to procreate new Celestial offsprings, in doing so sired thousands of children. While thousands of his offsprings are scattered across the cosmos, Ego then hired the Yondu Ravager Clan to abduct and transport some of his offsprings to his planet, generously compensated them until this led Yondu Udonta to an exile after violating the Ravager code. When his children failed to inherit the Celestial DNA, Ego killed them all painlessly.",
